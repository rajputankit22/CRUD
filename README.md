# CRUD
create, read, update and delete (as an acronym CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage in mongoose.
Different users may have different CRUD cycles based upon the requirements of the system. A customer, for instance,
might have the ability to create an account, retrieve it upon return to a website, update billing information, or 
delete it if necessary. An operations manager, by contrast, might create product records, call them up as needed, 
modify packaging or raw materials details or delete it if the product was discontinued.
